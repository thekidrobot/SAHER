          <h1> We Believe </h1>
          <p>An openness to learn from multiple realities broadens our perspective<br />
          Acceptance and appreciation of differences makes the world a beautiful and multilayered mosaic<br />
          Freedom of choice leads to a greater sense of ownership towards shared spaces<br />

          <p>
            Young people have immense potential to think constructively to bring about positive change<br />
Every individual has an active citizen in him/her waiting to be revealed through the appropriate sparks<br />
The ability to question absolute power and  the zeal to initiate positive action creates a society that is more just and equitable<br />
