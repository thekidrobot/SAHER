          <p>The beginning of our work goes back to December 1992 when the
          destruction of a mosque in Uttar Pradesh, India by fundamentalist
          forces changed the social fabric and the historical context in which
          an entire generation would be growing up. The tremors of the communal
          conflict that ensued were felt across the length and breadth of India
          and particularly in the commercial capital of Bombay where the meaning
          of identity took a twisted turn for young people. The futures of many
          of these youth would change forever and move in unprecedented
          directions. Some were fed on the alienation and discrimination
          resulting in the infamous bomb blasts of March 1993, while there were
          others who picked up the pieces to rebuild communities. SAHER's story
          is the story of one such community that suffered atrocities, but
          emerged out of the darkness with a light that would touch many lives
          positively. A bunch of youth from Jogeshwari developed a deep fear of
          communal riots and resolved that no one should ever go through what
          their familes and friends had experienced in 1992-'93. They got
          together to start a cricket club and a theatre group that would spread
          the message of peace, fostering intercommunity interactions and
          building respect for diversity.<br /><br />

          Taking the initiative further, we realised that communal violence and mob frenzy
          is momentary and ends within a few days. What linger on are deep scars of
          alienation, discrimination and mistrust, across communities. It takes decades to
          embalm these wounds that lurk in the minds of people. Over the years, people
          residing in communal ghettoes have made little efforts to know the 'other' and
          though children and youth meet in formal spaces of schools and colleges,
          stereotypes and mental constructs about each other run very deep. Educational
          systems emphasizing a qualification and a career orientation seldom delve into
          the social aspect of nurturing a citizen who is aware, responsible and sensitive
          to the world around.</p>
