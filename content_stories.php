          <h1>Saima</h1>
          <p>Saima, an 18 year old from Tolani college says "I used to think that
          Hindus and Muslims must live within their own distinct communities.
          After working together with people from different communities when I
          volunteered for the Sports Meet made me realize that it's much more fun
          to know different people and their views. I feel comfortable with
          everyone". Saima has been a part of the youth and active citizenship
          programme as a volunteer in events organized by SAHER and has
          participated in sessions on identity and diversity, diversity rally,
          camp on sustainable development and discussions on community work.</p>

          <h1>Bala</h1>
          <p>Bala, living in a Hindu dominated settlement held up a paper bag he
          had just made out of newspapers. "I plan to use this to carry my
          Karate uniform instead of the plastic bags I've been carrying so far".
          The lanky 19 year old was part of a group of around 40 young boys and
          girls from Hindu and Muslim communities engaged in understanding
          issues related to environment and sustainable development. They went
          for a camp at an organic farm in Panchgani, returned to script a
          street play on the hazards of using plastic and their efforts
          culminated in a campaign on "Volunteering for Our Planet" on 5th
          December 2009. Now, Bala has his closest friends among Muslims and is
          a regular volunteer at SAHER's Community Centre.</p>

          <h1>Heena</h1>
          <p>Heena's family believed that women need to be married young, so she
          was married shortly after she finished her secondary school education,
          when she was 20 years old. Heena's husband is a volunteer for SAHER,
          and he was given the opportunity to attend the Planning for Life
          Training of Trainers on reproductive health. Shortly thereafter,
          Heena's husband encouraged her to attend SAHER's reproductive health
          education sessions for young women, stating his newfound belief that
          every young woman and man must be aware of reproductive health issues. 

          Heena comes across as a quiet woman, but states very clearly that her family has
          very defined and separate set of rules for a son and a daughter where education
          was always the prerogative of the son and at the same time, of least importance
          to a daughter who would ultimately go away to her in-laws' home and take care of
          household chores and then give birth to babies. The lessons on gender role
          stereotypes and gender based sexual violence compelled Heena to challenge her
          own gender perceptions. She says, "We often discriminate between a male child
          and a female child. I have also been party to such discriminatory behavior, but
          now I make conscious efforts to treat both my children equally." Heena has
          shared all of the information that she learned at the RH workshop with her
          mother, mother in-law and friends. She wishes to pass on the information to her
          daughter as she grows up and promises to ensure that her daughter is properly
          educated and is enabled to make informed choices in life.</p>

          <h1>Dhyanchand</h1>
          <p>Dhyanchand is 19 years old and came to SAHER with little knowledge
          about what career to pursue. Since he had to reappear for his standard
          12 exams, he had ample time and did not know what to do in free time.
          His mother got to know about computer education being imparted through
          the SAHER community centre and suggested him to utilize that time to
          learn computers since it will be added knowledge and give him an edge
          over others to secure a job. His journey with SAHER began last year
          and within two months he completed the basic computers course. Seeing
          his dilemma regarding career choices, the computer instructor started
          providing career counseling as and when needed. Gradually he learnt
          about the Defence services and did in-depth research. Now Dhyanchand
          aspires to complete his graduation and join National Defence Academy
          (NDA) as a young cadet. In the meanwhile since his results are awaited
          he appeared for interviews at various places and took up a job with a
          corporate house in their sales team. He soon realized that his
          computer skills helped him get this job as his work involves using a
          laptop to promote a product and provide free samples to people he has
          to reach out to.</p>
